# ⭐ SSIL Conformance Specification

**Deterministic Structural Irreversibility Governance Standard**  
**No Prediction • No Equation Modification • No Nondeterminism**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines **strict conformance requirements** for any implementation claiming compliance with the Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer (SSIL).

Conformance is **binary**.

There is:

- No partial compliance  
- No compatible subset  
- No approximate SSIL  
- No interpretation-based equivalence  

An implementation either satisfies this specification fully — or it does not conform.

Conformance is defined **structurally, not institutionally**.

---

## 2. Finite Irreversibility Regime Requirement

A conforming implementation must define:

`R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`

Requirements:

- `|R| = 5`
- No additional irreversibility states
- No probabilistic blending
- No dynamic regime creation
- No runtime vocabulary expansion
- No adaptive regime injection

The irreversibility state space must remain **finite and invariant**.

Expansion of regime vocabulary invalidates conformance.

---

## 3. Conservative Magnitude Preservation Requirement

The implementation must define:

`phi((m,a,s,r)) = m`

Requirements:

- Magnitude `m` must never be altered
- Structural irreversibility classification must not modify measured values
- No transformation of `m` permitted
- No smoothing, scaling, reinterpretation, or proxy substitution

SSIL is a **conservative governance overlay**.

Any modification of magnitude invalidates conformance.

---

## 4. Bounded Horizon Requirement

A conforming implementation must define a finite horizon:

`H ≥ 1`

Irreversibility decisions must use only:

`W_H(t) = {t-H+1, ..., t}`

Requirements:

- `H` must be declared prior to execution
- `H` must remain fixed during execution
- No adaptive window resizing
- No infinite memory
- No forward-looking evaluation

Unbounded or adaptive horizon invalidates conformance.

---

## 5. Deterministic Structural Quantities

At each tick `t`, the implementation must compute deterministic structural quantities including:

`A(t)` — asymmetry accumulation  
`E_rev(t)` — reversibility envelope  

Differences:

`dA(t) = A(t) - A(t-1)`  
`dE(t) = E_rev(t) - E_rev(t-1)`

The canonical kernel must implement:

`dA_plus(t) = alpha * clamp(D(t) + beta*P(t) + gamma*S(t), 0, 1)`

`dA_relief(t) = rho * alpha * clamp((1 - D(t)) * (1 - B(t)) * (1 - S(t)), 0, 1)`

`A(t) = clamp(A(t-1) + dA_plus(t) - dA_relief(t), 0, 1)`

Requirements:

- All structural quantities must be deterministic
- All predicates must be total
- All thresholds must be declared and fixed
- No adaptive tuning
- No probabilistic arbitration

Nondeterministic predicate evaluation invalidates conformance.

---

## 6. EdgeZero Predicate Requirement

The implementation must define:

`EdgeZero_H(t) ∈ {TRUE, FALSE}`

EdgeZero must be derived deterministically using only bounded window data.

Requirements:

- Monotonic structural checks must be deterministic
- Envelope breach condition must be explicit
- Recovery must be structurally evaluated
- No probabilistic inference
- No heuristic override

Implicit or probabilistic boundary crossing invalidates conformance.

---

## 7. Recovery Predicate Requirement

The implementation must define:

`Recovery_H(t) ∈ {TRUE, FALSE}`

Requirements:

- Recovery must be structurally earned within `W_H(t)`
- Recovery cannot be assumed
- Recovery must be deterministic
- No probabilistic confidence scoring

Recovery inference through prediction invalidates conformance.

---

## 8. Irreversibility Classification Requirement

At each tick:

`r(t) ∈ {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`

Requirements:

- Classification must be deterministic
- State transitions must be reproducible
- No stochastic arbitration
- No runtime state injection

Irreversibility classification must be fully replay-verifiable.

---

## 9. Continuation Admissibility Requirement

If continuation mapping is implemented, it must satisfy:

`IRR_ADM(t) ∈ {CONTINUE, ABSTAIN}`

Requirements:

- Admissibility must depend only on structural predicates
- Admissibility must be deterministic
- No confidence weighting
- No probabilistic scoring
- No adaptive override

Admissibility must not modify magnitude.

---

## 10. Hyperparameter Lock Requirement

All constants must remain fixed during execution.

The declared hyperparameter set must include:

- `H`
- `delta_max`
- `s_max`
- `alpha`
- `beta`
- `gamma`
- `wA`
- `wB`
- `wS`
- `eta`
- `rho`

No runtime adaptation is permitted.

Hyperparameter mutation invalidates replay identity:

`B_A = B_B`

---

## 11. Deterministic Replay Requirement

Under identical declared inputs and fixed parameters:

Two independent executions must produce identical artifact bundles.

Replay equivalence condition:

`B_A = B_B`

Equality requires:

- Byte-identical CSV artifacts
- Identical irreversibility sequences
- Identical admissibility decisions
- Identical SHA-256 digests
- Identical conformance manifest

There is:

- No tolerance
- No approximate equality
- No statistical similarity

Replay identity is mandatory for conformance.

---

## 12. Canonical Verification Profile Requirement

For public conformance demonstration, the canonical verification profile must:

- Declare fixed parameters prior to execution
- Disallow adaptive thresholding
- Disallow runtime parameter mutation
- Normalize execution environment (timezone, hash seed, locale)
- Enforce SHA-256 fingerprint verification

The canonical verification case must be reproducible via:

`VERIFY_SSIL_CAPSULE/`

Fingerprint mismatch invalidates conformance.

Replay identity and fingerprint lock are jointly authoritative.

---

## 13. Prohibited Behaviors

An implementation does not conform if it introduces:

- Randomness
- Probabilistic inference
- Adaptive thresholds
- Confidence scoring
- Heuristic smoothing
- Tolerance-based collapse
- Nondeterministic output ordering
- Non-reproducible artifacts
- Runtime regime expansion
- Magnitude modification
- Forward prediction logic

Strict determinism is required.

---

## 14. Dataset Neutrality Requirement

Conformance must not depend on:

- Specific physical domains
- Thermodynamics
- Financial data
- Mechanical systems
- AI systems
- Infrastructure traces

Core conformance must be demonstrable using deterministic synthetic traces.

External datasets may validate universality — but they do not define conformance.

Structural invariants define conformance — not empirical domains.

---

## 15. Binary Conformance Rule

An implementation either satisfies all requirements or it does not conform.

There is:

- No partial conformance
- No degraded conformance
- No SSIL-inspired category
- No interpretive compliance

Conformance is binary.

---

## Final Structural Condition

Conformance requires preservation of:

Finite irreversibility regime set:

`R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`

Conservative collapse invariant:

`phi((m,a,s,r)) = m`

Deterministic bounded horizon `H`  
Deterministic recovery predicate  
Deterministic `EdgeZero` predicate  
Deterministic continuation mapping  
Replay equivalence:

`B_A = B_B`

Canonical fingerprint verification  
Dataset neutrality

Magnitude remains primary.  
Irreversibility remains finite.  
Continuation governance is deterministic.  
Replay identity is authoritative.

**SSIL conformance is structural — not interpretive.**
