# ⭐ SSIL Structural Irreversibility Model

**Deterministic Structural Irreversibility Governance Framework**  
**No Equation Modification • No Prediction • No Control Injection**

---

## 1. Scope

This document defines the formal irreversibility governance model used by the Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer (SSIL).

It specifies:

- Finite irreversibility regime set  
- Deterministic bounded horizon evaluation  
- Structural recovery predicate  
- EdgeZero boundary detection  
- Continuation admissibility mapping  
- Replay identity guarantees  

It does not describe physical laws.  
It does not introduce predictive modeling.

It defines **structural irreversibility topology only**.

---

## 2. Classical Preservation

SSIL preserves classical measurable magnitude exactly.

Core invariant:

`phi((m,a,s,r)) = m`

Requirements:

- Measured magnitude `m` is never altered  
- Domain equations remain untouched  
- No reinterpretation of physical law occurs  

Irreversibility classification is observational only.

---

## 3. Finite Irreversibility Regime Set

SSIL defines a finite irreversibility state space:

`R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`

Where:

- `R0` — reversible posture  
- `E0` — EdgeZero boundary crossing  
- `I1` — early irreversible posture  
- `I2` — deep irreversible posture  
- `C` — committed / terminal irreversible state  

Properties:

- `|R| = 5`  
- Finite  
- Closed under deterministic classification  
- Replay-stable  

No additional regime may be introduced.

SSIL governs continuation permission — not magnitude evolution law.

---

## 4. Deterministic Structural Quantities

For ordered observations at tick `t`, define:

`A(t)` — structural asymmetry accumulation  
`E_rev(t)` — reversibility envelope capacity  

Differences:

`dA(t) = A(t) - A(t-1)`  
`dE(t) = E_rev(t) - E_rev(t-1)`

Properties:

- Deterministic  
- Bounded  
- Replay-verifiable  

No probabilistic estimation occurs.  
No adaptive thresholds are permitted.

Asymmetry accumulation includes a conservative relief term scaled by `rho`,  
ensuring structural reduction is possible only under deterministic relief conditions.

---

## 5. Bounded Horizon Model

Define a finite structural horizon:

`H ≥ 1`

Window definition:

`W_H(t) = {t-H+1, ..., t}`

All irreversibility decisions must be derived solely from `W_H(t)`.

Properties:

- Finite memory  
- No infinite accumulation  
- No forward forecasting  
- No adaptive window resizing  

Irreversibility is evaluated locally in time.

---

## 6. Recovery Predicate

Define:

`Recovery_H(t) ∈ {TRUE, FALSE}`

Recovery holds if and only if structural return capacity exists within `W_H(t)`.

Properties:

- Deterministic  
- Window-bound  
- Structurally earned  
- Not probabilistically inferred  

Recovery cannot be assumed — it must be structurally demonstrated.

---

## 7. EdgeZero Boundary Predicate

Define:

`EdgeZero_H(t) ∈ {TRUE, FALSE}`

EdgeZero occurs when structural envelope compression and asymmetry monotonicity co-exist within the bounded window and recovery is not satisfied.

Properties:

- Deterministic  
- Posture-based  
- No probabilistic override  
- No heuristic collapse  

EdgeZero defines structural irreversibility onset.

---

## 8. Irreversibility Classification

At each tick:

`r(t) ∈ {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`

Classification is derived deterministically from:

- Recovery predicate  
- EdgeZero predicate  
- Structural posture conditions  

Properties:

- Finite  
- Closed  
- Replay-verifiable  
- No dynamic state injection  

Irreversibility state is explicit and bounded.

---

## 9. Continuation Admissibility Mapping

Define:

`IRR_ADM(t) ∈ {CONTINUE, ABSTAIN}`

Mapping rules:

If `r(t) = R0` → `CONTINUE`  
If `r(t) ∈ {E0, I1, I2, C}` → `ABSTAIN`

Properties:

- Deterministic  
- Binary  
- Non-probabilistic  
- Magnitude-preserving  

Continuation governance does not modify domain output.

---

## 10. Replay Identity Authority

Let:

`B` = artifact bundle produced by execution

Replay equivalence requires:

`B_A = B_B`

Where equality means:

- Byte-identical CSV artifacts  
- Identical irreversibility sequences  
- Identical admissibility decisions  
- Identical SHA-256 digests  
- Identical conformance manifest  

Determinism is validated through replay identity and canonical fingerprint verification.

---

## 11. Finite Irreversibility Theorem

Under deterministic structural predicates:

`|R| = 5`

Irreversibility classification remains within `{R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`.

No additional regime may emerge.  
Vocabulary growth is prohibited.  
Irreversibility grammar is fixed.

---

## 12. Conservative Governance Principle

SSIL is a conservative structural overlay.

It:

- Does not replace thermodynamics  
- Does not alter magnitude  
- Does not simulate dynamics  
- Does not introduce probabilistic models  
- Does not inject control authority  

It governs structural continuation permission only.

---

## 13. Cross-Domain Universality Condition

If a system provides:

- Ordered observable state evolution  
- Deterministic parameter publication  
- Finite irreversibility classification  
- Replay identity discipline  

Then SSIL applies.

No domain-specific physics is required for irreversibility governance.

---

## 14. Non-Claims

The SSIL Structural Irreversibility Model does not:

- Predict failure  
- Forecast cascade events  
- Model thermodynamic entropy  
- Guarantee system safety  
- Modify physical equations  
- Replace domain control systems  

It governs structural irreversibility posture only.

---

## Final Structural Statement

SSIL irreversibility governance is defined by:

Finite irreversibility regime set:

`R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`

Conservative magnitude preservation:

`phi((m,a,s,r)) = m`

Deterministic bounded horizon `H`  
Recovery predicate discipline  
EdgeZero predicate discipline  
Continuation mapping `IRR_ADM(t)`  
Replay identity:

`B_A = B_B`

Magnitude remains primary.  
Irreversibility becomes finite.  
Continuation becomes governed.  
Execution becomes deterministic.  
Verification becomes replayable.
