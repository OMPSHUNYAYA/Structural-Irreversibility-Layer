**No Prediction • No Control • No Equation Modification**

# SECTION A — Purpose & Positioning

## A1. What is SSIL, in simple terms?

SSIL (Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer) is a **deterministic structural layer** that governs whether a system’s continuation remains structurally reversible.

It does not change physics.  
It does not modify equations.  
It does not predict outcomes.

It introduces a **finite irreversibility grammar** over system evolution.

---

## A2. Why is SSIL needed if classical systems already evaluate stability?

Classical systems ask:

- Is the value correct?  
- Is the equation satisfied?  
- Is the system stable?  

They do not formally ask:

- Is continuation still structurally reversible?  

SSIL governs that boundary — deterministically.

---

## A3. Does SSIL replace thermodynamics, physics, or domain equations?

No.

SSIL is a **conservative extension**.

Collapse invariant:

`phi((m,a,s,r)) = m`

- Magnitude remains exactly as computed  
- Domain equations remain untouched  
- SSIL overlays continuation governance only  

---

## A4. Is SSIL probabilistic or machine-learned?

No.

SSIL:

- Uses a finite discrete regime set  
- Uses no probability  
- Performs no statistical inference  
- Uses no machine learning  
- Uses no adaptive thresholds  

All behavior is deterministic and replay-verifiable.

# SECTION B — Finite Irreversibility Grammar

## B1. What are the irreversibility regimes?

`R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`

Where:

- `R0` — Reversible regime  
- `E0` — EdgeZero boundary crossing  
- `I1` — Early irreversible posture  
- `I2` — Deep irreversible posture  
- `C` — Committed / terminal irreversible state  

---

## B2. Is the regime set expandable?

No.

`|R| = 5`

No additional runtime regimes are permitted.  
Expansion invalidates conformance.

---

## B3. What does SSIL evaluate?

Given a structured observation:

`X(t) = (m(t), a(t), s(t))`

SSIL computes:

`X(t) = (m(t), a(t), s(t), r(t))`

Where:

- `m(t)` = classical magnitude  
- `a(t)` = structural alignment  
- `s(t)` = accumulated posture  
- `r(t) ∈ {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}` = irreversibility state  

Magnitude is never modified.

---

# SECTION C — Deterministic Irreversibility Logic

## C1. What is the bounded horizon?

A finite window:

`H ≥ 1`

Irreversibility decisions use only:

`W_H(t) = {t-H+1, ..., t}`

- No infinite memory  
- No forecasting  
- No extrapolation  

---

## C2. What is the recovery predicate?

Recovery must be structurally earned within the bounded window.

`Recovery_H(t) ∈ {TRUE, FALSE}`

If recovery conditions fail, reversibility cannot be assumed.

---

## C3. What is EdgeZero?

EdgeZero is a deterministic structural boundary crossing:

`EdgeZero_H(t) ∈ {TRUE, FALSE}`

It occurs when:

- Asymmetry accumulates monotonically  
- Envelope compresses monotonically  
- `A(t) > E_rev(t)`  
- No recovery signature exists  

No probability.  
No prediction.  
Pure structural classification.

---

## C4. What is continuation admissibility?

`IRR_ADM(t) ∈ {CONTINUE, ABSTAIN}`

This governs permission to continue under irreversible posture.

It does not modify magnitude.  
It does not stop equations.  
It governs continuation reliance only.

---

# SECTION D — Determinism & Replay Identity

## D1. What does replay identity mean?

Two identical executions must produce:

`B_A = B_B`

Byte-identical artifacts.

---

## D2. What artifacts must match?

- State sequences (`r(t)`)  
- Irreversibility classifications  
- Output CSV files  
- SHA-256 manifests  

No tolerance windows are permitted.

---

## D3. Why is randomness prohibited?

Randomness breaks replay identity.

SSIL is execution-deterministic and machine-independent.

---

# SECTION E — What SSIL Prevents

## E1. What problem does SSIL address?

Without irreversibility governance:

- Systems continue past structural exhaustion  
- Envelope compression is ignored  
- Recovery capacity is assumed  
- Escalation occurs too late  

SSIL enforces deterministic structural restraint.

---

## E2. What does ABSTAIN mean?

`ABSTAIN` does not mean:

- Failure  
- Prediction  
- Instability  

It means:

Continuation is structurally inadmissible under deterministic irreversibility predicates.

---

# SECTION F — Cross-Domain Universality

## F1. Does SSIL apply only to physics?

No.

Any system with:

- Ordered observations  
- Structural posture accumulation  
- Reversible envelope concepts  

can be evaluated under SSIL.

---

## F2. Has SSIL been replay-verified?

Yes.

Verified across:

- Recovery traces  
- Full irreversibility arcs  
- Envelope starvation adversarial traces  
- Boundary skating adversarial traces  
- Multi-parameter sweeps  

All runs satisfy:

`phi((m,a,s,r)) = m`  
`IRR_ADM(t) ∈ {CONTINUE, ABSTAIN}`  
`B_A = B_B`

Determinism is demonstrated — not assumed.

---

# SECTION G — Scope & Non-Claims

## G1. What SSIL does NOT claim

SSIL does not:

- Predict failure  
- Replace thermodynamics  
- Replace domain equations  
- Optimize performance  
- Inject control signals  
- Guarantee safety outcomes  

It governs continuation admissibility only.

---

## G2. Is SSIL a safety certification?

No.

“Civilization-grade” refers strictly to deterministic verification discipline:

- Finite regime grammar  
- Deterministic predicates  
- Conservative collapse invariant  
- Replay-verifiable artifacts  

Independent regulatory certification is required for safety-critical deployment.

# SECTION H — Architectural Summary

Layered view:

Classical Layer → Magnitude evolution  
Structural Layer → Alignment & posture  
Irreversibility Layer → `R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}`  
Admissibility Layer → `IRR_ADM(t)`

All collapse through:

`phi((m,a,s,r)) = m`

Magnitude remains primary.  
Irreversibility becomes finite.  
Continuation becomes governed.

---

# ONE-LINE SUMMARY

Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer (SSIL) introduces a deterministic finite irreversibility grammar `R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}` over system evolution, preserving classical magnitude exactly via `phi((m,a,s,r)) = m` while governing continuation admissibility through bounded, replay-verifiable structural predicates across domains.
