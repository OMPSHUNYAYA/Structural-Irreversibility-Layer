No Restrictions

This Open Standard imposes no legal, technical, or commercial restrictions on use or implementation.

Attribution is not required.
No endorsement or certification is implied.
No runtime obligations apply.
No implementation approval is required.

Correctness and conformance are governed by deterministic structural behavior and replay identity — not by licensing terms.

Modified or extended versions must not be represented as the canonical SSIL Standard unless they preserve the normative structural requirements defined herein.


Recommended Attribution (Optional)

Attribution is recommended but not required.

Preferred form:

Implements Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer (SSIL).

Attribution must not imply endorsement by the authors or the Shunyaya framework.

Use of the name “Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer (SSIL)” must not imply:

• endorsement
• certification
• official compliance approval
• governance authority
• authorship by the original authors


Scope of the Standard

Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer (SSIL) defines a deterministic structural governance layer regulating continuation admissibility across irreversible boundaries.

SSIL establishes:

Finite irreversibility classification:

R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}

Conservative collapse invariant:

phi((m,a,s,r)) = m

Deterministic bounded horizon:

H >= 1

Deterministic recovery predicate:

Recovery_H(t)

EdgeZero predicate:

EdgeZero_H(t)

Continuation admissibility mapping:

IRR_ADM(t) ∈ {CONTINUE, ABSTAIN}

Replay identity discipline:

B_A = B_B

SSIL does not:

• modify physical laws
• redefine domain equations
• alter measured magnitude
• introduce predictive models
• simulate future states
• perform optimization
• inject control authority
• guarantee safety outcomes

SSIL governs continuation admissibility — not causation.


Conformance

An implementation conforms to the SSIL Open Standard if it:

Preserves magnitude exactly:

phi((m,a,s,r)) = m

Maintains finite irreversibility regime closure:

R = {R0, E0, I1, I2, C}
|R| = 5

Uses deterministic bounded horizon evaluation H.

Implements deterministic recovery and EdgeZero predicates.

Implements continuation mapping:

IRR_ADM(t) ∈ {CONTINUE, ABSTAIN}

Produces byte-identical artifacts under independent replay:

B_A = B_B

Avoids probabilistic or tolerance-based arbitration.

Any implementation introducing:

• randomness
• probabilistic inference
• adaptive thresholds
• predictive extrapolation
• tolerance-based comparison
• nondeterministic output
• runtime regime expansion

does not conform to the SSIL Open Standard.

Independent implementations are permitted and encouraged.


Relationship to Other Licenses

This Open Standard applies only to the SSIL specification and its normative structural definitions.

Reference implementations, example scripts, traces, adapters, datasets, or tooling may be released under separate licenses if explicitly stated.

This license governs the SSIL Standard specification text only. It does not automatically apply to reference implementations unless explicitly stated.

Implementation licensing does not alter structural conformance requirements of this Standard.

Nothing in this Standard grants trademark rights.


Responsibility

Use of SSIL in operational, infrastructure, AI, governance, industrial, financial, or safety-critical contexts is undertaken entirely at the user’s own responsibility.

SSIL provides:

• deterministic irreversibility classification
• bounded horizon evaluation
• explicit continuation governance
• replay-verifiable artifact reproducibility

It does not provide operational authority, regulatory certification, or safety guarantees.


No Warranty

THE STANDARD IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THIS STANDARD.


Closing Statement

Shunyaya Structural Irreversibility Layer (SSIL) is published as an Open Standard to maximize deterministic reproducibility, structural governance discipline, and independent verification of irreversible boundary behavior across domains.

It is governed by structure — not by permission.
